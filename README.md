# 🧬 Global Cancer Outcomes Analysis (2015–2024)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a **global cancer dataset containing 50,000+ patient records** collected between **2015 and 2024**.  
The objective is to uncover actionable insights related to **cancer severity, early diagnosis, survival outcomes, and treatment cost disparities** using data analytics.

---

## ⭐ Problem Statement (Situation)
Cancer outcomes vary significantly across demographics, lifestyle and genetic risk factors, and healthcare systems.  
Despite the availability of large-scale patient data, actionable insights are often underutilized, limiting improvements in **early detection, cost optimization, and patient-centered care strategies**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives (Task)
- Analyze demographic and clinical distributions of cancer patients  
- Identify relationships between lifestyle/genetic risk factors and cancer severity  
- Measure early-stage diagnosis rates by cancer type  
- Evaluate treatment cost disparities across age, gender, and countries  
- Test interaction effects between genetic risk and smoking  
- Identify key predictors of cancer severity and survival for future modeling  

---

## 🛠️ Methodology (Action)

### Data Processing
- Cleaned and validated **50K+ patient records**
- Ensured consistent data types and balanced categorical distributions

### Exploratory Analysis
- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Country  
- **Clinical Variables:** Cancer Type, Cancer Stage  
- **Outcomes:** Survival Years, Target Severity Score  

### Statistical & Analytical Techniques
- GroupBy aggregations and descriptive statistics  
- Regression analysis to evaluate risk–severity relationships  
- Interaction modeling (**Genetic Risk × Smoking**)  
- Treatment cost analysis across demographics and geography  

### Key Columns Analyzed
- `Age`, `Gender`, `Country`  
- `Cancer_Type`, `Cancer_Stage`  
- `Treatment_Cost_USD`, `Survival_Years`  
- `Target_Severity_Score`  
- `Genetic_Risk`, `Smoking`, `Alcohol_Use`, `Obesity_Level`, `Air_Pollution`  

---

## 📊 Key Insights (Result)
- Early-stage diagnosis rates range between **38–41%**, with **lung cancer showing lower detection rates**
- Individual risk factors exhibit **weak but positive relationships** with cancer severity
- Treatment costs are **highest in developed countries** and **increase sharply after age 60**
- Gender-based differences in treatment cost are minimal
- No statistically significant interaction between **genetic risk and smoking** was found

---

## 💡 Business & Healthcare Impact
- Highlights the importance of **targeted early detection strategies**, particularly for lung cancer  
- Reveals the **economic burden on elderly populations**, supporting healthcare policy planning  
- Demonstrates the need for **multivariate and machine learning models** to better predict cancer severity
